# ETG---BREAST-CANCER-DETECTION

### PYTHON CODE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THE BREAST CANCER IS THE MALIGNANT TUMOR OR BENIGN TUMOR USING THE DEEP LEARNING BASED SEQUENTIAL MODEL

- Deep Learning (DL) is a type of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge
- In this Deep Learning Model, it predicts whether the breat cancer is the Benign Tumor or Malignant Tumor
- At first, the data is collected from the inbuilt sklearn library
- Then, the collected data is preprocessed and trained
- Before Training the model, the preprocessed data is splitted into three categories
- First is Training Data, then Validation Data and finally Test Data
- The Model is first trained using Training data and then it is evaluated using Validation data
- The accuracy of the Model is predicted using the Test data which is unseen by the Model
